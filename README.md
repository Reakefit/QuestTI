# QuestTI

Auto Turn in quest and retake it, adjust the images to select the quest to auto turn in. To run the program make sure python3 is installed and run the program with the game open and selected.

To adjust the quests just change the images to the quest needed and the program will handle the rest.
Future plans include autopickup as well.
